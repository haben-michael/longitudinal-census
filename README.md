# longitudinal-census

A visualization of the longitudinal census data accompanying the paper:

Logan, John R., Zengwang Xu, and Brian J. Stults. 2014. "Interpolating US Decennial Census Tract Data from as Early as 1970 to 2010: A Longitudinal Tract Database" The Professional Geographer 66(3): 412–420.

[Live version](https://github.com/haben-michael/longitudinal-census/blob/master/census.html)

The current build is in javascript with leaflet and D3 but R/shiny implementation is among the older files.

## USAGE
A formula using census variable names may be input in the upper right form. The left/right arrow keys advance the map through the decades.

## TODO
  * average over several tracts after selecting with mouse
  * choice of color gradient--need diverging for neg/pos values
  * bins issue--quantiles lump large ranges
  * disable keyboard/mouse handlers when editing infobox
