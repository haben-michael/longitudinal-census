G3   258        A Active governmental unit, except American Indian reservations

G3   258        A ental unit has the legal capacity to have officers, to raise r
G3   258        A evenue, and to conduct governmental activities under State law
G3   258        A s, and currently is doing so.
G3   258        B Functioning governmental unit providing no substantive governm
G3   258        B ental services. These areas may be coextensive with and admini
G3   258        B stered by officials of another governmental unit (such as town
G3   258        B s in Connecticut that are coextensive with cities), or the num
G3   258        B ber of officials and/or the functions they perform are so mini
G3   258        B mal and/or vestigial that the Census Bureau does not recognize
G3   258        B them as governmental units for census purposes (such as townsh

G3   258        F False entity. In order to maintain complete coverage of every 
G3   258        F State at the county level and of every county at the county su
G3   258        F bdivision level, we create false entities at these levels for
G3   258        F any place that is independent of a county or independent of a
G3   258        F minor civil division (MCD). This code also is used for place r
G3   258        F ecords that represent the remainder of a consolidated city or
G3   258        F the remainder of a county subdivision.
G3   258        I Inactive governmental unit. An inactive governmental unit has 
G3   258        I the legal capacity to be active, but currently has no legal of
G3   258        I ficers, raises no revenues, and conducts no activities.
G3   258        N Nonfunctioning governmental unit. A nonfunctioning governmenta
G3   258        N l unit has legally established boundaries, but has no legal ca
G3   258        N pacity to conduct governmental activity.
G3   258        R An American Indian reservation, an American Indian tribe whose
G3   258        R name is associated with trust lands, or an Alaska Native villa
G3   258        R ge statistical area.
G3   258        S Statistical entity, except Alaska Native village statistical a
G3   258        S reas and tribal jurisdiction statistical areas. A statistical
G3   258        S entity has no governmental status and is defined by or in coop
G3   258        S eration with the Census Bureau or other Federal agency. This c

G3   258        T Tribal jurisdiction statistical area. A tribal jurisdiction st
G3   258        T atistical area (TJSA) is not a legally defined governmental un
G3   258        T it, but is recognized as a statistical area for the 1990 censu
